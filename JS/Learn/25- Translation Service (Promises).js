/**
 *  About Promises
 * 
 *  The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation,
 *  and its resulting value.
 *  
 *  The methods: 
 *  - promise.then(),
 *  - promise.catch(),
 *  - promise.finally() 
 *  are used to associate further action with a promise that becomes settled.
 * 
 *  For example:
 * 
 *  const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
 *      const myArray = [1,2,3,4,5];
 *      const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * myArray.length + 1);
 *  
 *      if(myArray[randomNumber]){
 *          resolve(myArray[randomNumber]);
 *      }
 *      
 *      reject(new Error('Array index error!'));
 *  })
 * 
 *  myPromise
 *      .then((onfulfilled) => {
 *          console.log(onfulfilled);
 *      })
 *      .catch((error) => {
 *          console.error('Error:', error.message);
 *          return Promise.reject(error);
 *      })
 *      .finally(function () {
 *          console.log('Promise completed');
 *      });

/**
 *  Instructions
 * 
 *  In this exercise, you'll be providing a TranslationService that provides basic translation services to
 *  free members, and advanced translation to premium members with quality assurances.
 */

/**
 *  The API
 * 
 *  You have found an outer space translation API that fulfills any translation request in a reasonable amount of time.
 *  You want to capitalize on this. The space translators are extremely fickle and hate redundancy,
 *  so they also provide API storage satellites where you can fetch past translations without bothering them.
 */

/**
 *  Fetching a translation
 *  
 *  api.fetch(text) fetches a translation of text from the API storage and returns a promise that provides two values:
 *  
 *  - translation: the actual translation
 *  - quality: the quality expressed as a number
 * 
 *  If a translation is not found in the API storage,
 *  the API throws a NotAvailable error. Translations can be added using the api.request method.
 *  If 'text' is not translatable, the API throws an Untranslatable error.
 * 
 *  api.fetch('jIyaj'); // => Promise({ resolved: 'I understand' })
 */

/**
 *  Requesting a translation
 *  
 *  Some translations are sure to exist, but haven't been added to the API storage yet.
 *  That's the difference between NotAvailable ( not in storage, but can be requested ) and
 *  Untranslatable ( cannot be translated ).
 *  
 *  api.request(text, callback) requests that a translation of text be performed and added into the API storage.
 *  On completion the callback function is called.
 * 
 *  - On success callback is passed undefined: 
 *      this indicates the translation was successful and is accessible using the api.fetch method.
 * 
 *  - On failure callback is passed an error: 
 *      this indicates something went wrong. The outspace API is unstable, which means that the API fails often.
 *      If that happens, it is okay to api.request again.
 * 
 * 
    api.request('majQaâ€™', callback);
    // => undefined
    //
    // later: the passed callback is called with undefined
    //        because it was successful.
 */

/**
 *  Warning
 * 
 *  The API works its magic by teleporting in the various translators when a request comes in.
 *  This is a very costly action, so it shouldn't be called when a translation is available.
 *  Unfortunately, not everyone reads the manual, so there is a system in place to kick-out bad actors.
 *
 *  If an api.request is called for text is available, the API throws an AbusiveClientError for this call,
 *  and every call after that. Ensure that you never request a translation if something has already been translated.
